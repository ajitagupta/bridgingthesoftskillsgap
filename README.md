Title of this post is eponymous to the book by Bruce Tulgan.

1. Working in Teams
* Team lead should introduce you and help you in getting started
* Read documentation or tutorial to understand the expectations
* Get a hang of the project vocabulary to have a starting point for conversation with teammates


That said, you are never going to find the perfect work environment so invest your energy into the betterment of the current one.
