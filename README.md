Title of this post is eponymous to a great [book](https://www.amazon.com/Bridging-Soft-Skills-Gap-Missing/dp/1118725646/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IX0QI0ATUVKX&dchild=1&keywords=bridging+the+soft+skills+gap&qid=1593540443&s=books&sprefix=bridging+the+soft%2Caps%2C256&sr=1-1) by management coach and trainer Bruce Tulgan.
Certain people are acutely smart in their work. Others have an edge on the social side. However, in order to be truly successful it necessitates one to blend in one well with the other. Thence, I have created a compendium of guidelines to follow in order to communicate and connect better.

### 1. Working in Teams
* Team lead should introduce you and help you in getting started (e.g. through a kick-off meeting)
* Read documentation or tutorial to understand the expectations (perhaps there is one for onboarding)
* Get a hang of the project vocabulary to have a starting point for conversation with teammates


That said, you are never going to find the perfect work environment so invest your energy into the betterment of the current one. On the rare occasion that there is no way out you should leave.
