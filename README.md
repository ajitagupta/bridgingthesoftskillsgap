# Bridging the Soft Skills Gap

Certain people are acutely smart in their work (technical, *hard skills*). Others have an edge on the social side (non-technical, *soft skills*). Soft skills refer to elements of professionalism, critical thinking and followership. When employees have significant gaps in their soft skills there are significant negative consequences, e.g. good hires are overlooked, people become distracted, customer service suffers, conflicts occur more frequently, unnecessary costs arise.

In order to be truly successful it necessitates one to blend in one well with the other to engage and work together effectively with others. You cannot have a functional workplace where everybody makes his or her own rules of conduct. Conforming to a set of basic practices is adequate and makes sense here. Thence, I have created a compendium of guidelines to follow to be able to communicate well and connect better.

The title of this post is eponymous to a great [book](https://www.amazon.com/Bridging-Soft-Skills-Gap-Missing/dp/1118725646/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IX0QI0ATUVKX&dchild=1&keywords=bridging+the+soft+skills+gap&qid=1593540443&s=books&sprefix=bridging+the+soft%2Caps%2C256&sr=1-1) by management coach and trainer Bruce Tulgan, on which this post is based. Further, ideas mentioned have been borrowed from the bestseller in Software Engineering [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=6GKZD0PUB6QK&dchild=1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer&qid=1593635880&s=books&sprefix=pragmatic%2Caps%2C252&sr=1-2).

* Get a hang of the project vocabulary to have a starting point for conversation with teammates


Soft skills cannot be spoon fed or forced upon someone. They are about regulation of the self and must be fully embraced to be learned. If done right one can only estimate the incredible potential and added value of unlocking the full power of soft skills. That said, you are never going to find the perfect work environment so invest your energy into the betterment of the current one. On the rare occasion that there is no way out you should leave.
