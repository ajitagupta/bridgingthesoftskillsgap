# Bridging the Soft Skills Gap

Certain people are acutely smart in their work (technical, easy to measure, *hard skills*). Others have an edge on the social side (non-technical, broad, *soft skills*). When employees have significant gaps in their soft skills there are significant negative consequences, e.g. good hires are overlooked, customer service suffers, conflicts occur more frequently, unnecessary costs arise. Nine times out of ten an unsuccessful hire fails due to soft skills, not hard.

You cannot have a functional workplace where everybody makes his or her own rules of conduct. Conforming to a set of basic practices is adequate and makes sense here. Thence, I have hunt down those guidelines and created a compendium out of them.

The title of this post is eponymous to a [great book](https://www.amazon.com/Bridging-Soft-Skills-Gap-Missing/dp/1118725646/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IX0QI0ATUVKX&dchild=1&keywords=bridging+the+soft+skills+gap&qid=1593540443&s=books&sprefix=bridging+the+soft%2Caps%2C256&sr=1-1) by management coach Bruce Tulgan on which much of this post is based.

### 1. Self-Evaluation
When it comes to continuous improvement of any kind self-evaluation is the beginning, middle and end. It refers to assessing one's own thoughts, words and actions against clear, meaningful standards; and one's own performance against specific goals, timelines, guidelines and parameters. Regular self-evaluation will build self-awareness and support your learning and growth going forward. Checklist includes 
* ability
* technical skills
* soft skills
* motivation
* productivity
* quality
* behavior
### 2. Personal Responsibility
The goal here is to take greater responsibility by learning to stay focused on what you can control directly and not defer the blame on external uncontrollable factors. At every step, ask yourself the following:
* What is within my control right now?
* Where will I focus my attention and energy? What are the options?
* What's the plan? What are my next steps?

Make a list of all the stones lying in the way and work out a response to remove them.
### 3. Attitude
According to studies good employee attitude drive positive results. Bad employee attitude put a drag on results. Attitude is very, very important. It is changeable and definitely not a personal issue. Neither is it a vague term. A great attitude is defined by several traits (in the given order):
* expressions
* words
* tone
* gestures
* optimism
* generosity
* enthusiasm

Leverage good behavior and strengths. Identify bad attitude and take corrective action when it happens. Do not accept failure. If you learn to display a positive attitude regardless of how you feel inside, then you will have learned one of the most important broad transferable skills you could ever learn.
### 4. Work Habits
The company's business is directly impacted by work habits, e.g. coming late, not paying attention to detail and not taking initiative, all lead to missed opportunities. Good habits refer to
* wellness (healthy body, mind, spirit)
* self-presentation (grooming, attire, manners)
* timeliness (arriving early, staying late, taking short breaks, meeting schedules and deadlines)
* organization (taking notes, project plans, checklists, filing)
* productivity (pace of work)
* attention to details (following instructions, standards and specifications)
* follow-through (finishing commitments and started projects)
* initiative (no explicit direction, the extra mile)

Maintain a schedule to keep score and track progress. It takes weeks of practice to incorporate and form new habits. But the products of good habits are visible and so are the products of bad habits. It's your judgment call.
### 5. People Skills
Poor communication is a result of not following communication best practices and primary cause of unnecessary problems in the workplace. Learning them will help you develop better habits and build better workplace relationships. These are:
* Attentive listening: Listen twice as much as you talk
* Observing and reading: Don't interrupt or let your mind wander when others speak
* Perceiving and empathizing: Put yourself in the other person's position
* Effective use of words: Prepare in advance to keep things brief, direct and clear. Don't speak of a problem unless you have thought of at least one potential solution. Take responsibility for everything you say and do. No excuses.
* Tone and expressions: Take yourself less seriously, but give credit where due and stick to your commitments and responsibilities.

Put structure into your communication by scheduling meetings and following a well-organized agenda. Recap the meeting, the following steps and timeline.
### 6. Proactive Learning
Leading research says if you are not actively learning you actually become a little dumber every day. Merely the effort of learning is great exercise and strengthens your mind. Proactive learning is the first step to developing critical thinking skills and consists of
* keeping an open mind
* suspending judgment, questioning assumptions and seeking out information (by asking good questions and drafting a research plan)
* studying, practicing and contemplating

Knowledge comes from studying good information. Skills comes from practicing good technique, whereas wisdom originates from appreciating and understanding multiple perspectives.
### 7. Problem-Solving
Most problems that arise at the workplace have been seen before. That means solutions exist and can be learnt. Moreover, by drawing on elements of ready-made solutions one begins to understand and appreciate common denominators and underlying principles, making it easier to improvise and tackle unanticipated problems. More specifically,
* inspect and study the most common recurring problems that you encounter at work; create a standard procedure to prevent or avoid these problems in future 
* find general principles in existing standard procedures; identify common denominators and consider how to use them for rarely occurring problems
* perform after-action reviews and learn from them
### 8. Decision-Making
The key to decision-making is seeing patterns in causes and their effects and thinking ahead with insight, thereby projecting likely outcomes and consequences of decisions and actions. This can be as simple as in a game of chess or as intricate as a strategic move in times of war. The way to play the game is
* identifying the players and conditions
* deeply researching on the impact of the decision (both positive and negative outcomes)
* performing after-action reviews and learning from them
* forming an action tree
### 9. Respect for Context
Respect for context is developed by learning to read and adapt to existing structure, rules, customs and leaders in an unfamiliar situation. Structure the context as follows:
* What is the context? (Describe the details)
* Where do I fit in?
* Why am I here? What is at stake for me?
* How can I adapt?
* What are the context-limiting factors (e.g. too much work, interruptions, unclear lines of authority)?

The purpose of respect for context is to work on tasks you enjoy, be comfortable and engaged.
### 10. Citizenship
The very meaning of loyalty is changing. The youngsters of today want just a job, earn huge amounts of money, build their skills or are still figuring out what to do next. Some also look to align their priorities with their job. Others follow a peer group. In all these cases there is an unwillingness to make personal sacrifice and not ask *What's in for me?*. Over time, the power of belonging and good citizenship comes from accepting, embracing and observing, not just the rights and rewards, but one's duties. Why should you care? You should know what really matters to you and what it's worth to you. You must feel really great about being here. What are the rules?
* Respect for others
* Best interests of the involved (mission, company, customers, employees, partners, vendors, community)
* Thinking civilly (monitoring, reporting, building coalitions, managing conflicts fairly)
* Communitarian (honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, courage)
* Common sense (courtesy, preparing for meetings in advance, personal responsibility)
* Adhere to solid standards (be on time, overdeliver, keep your word, practice old-fashioned good manners)
* Personal sacrifice (benefit of doubt, patience, candor, additional effort)
* Do the fair share of your work

Think about each of these points for a moment or two and ask yourself where you stand and how you could get better.
### 11. Service
According to the service mindset the organization, manager, colleagues, partners, vendors and customers - all of them but you - are customers. The best way to prove yourself is to give, sacrifice, suffer and give even more till it hurts. It's a huge investment in yourself and your growing reputation. If you want to receive special treatment you should be prepared to go the extra mile and earn it. Get input from your boss while you have the chance and think about what input you should be providing based on what you are learning on the front line.
### 12. Working in Teams
The key to bonding among young people working together is creating conditions in which they do lots of challenging work together under the strong direction of a highly committed leader. The strongest peer relationships form in environments with a strong focus on the shared mission, the shared work and the common ground. No matter where you work or what you do your work involves dealing with other people - internally and externally. In order to be a great team mate
* stay focused on the shared mission and 
* make yourself available and easy to work with
* coordinate, cooperate and collaborate with others
* play your assigned position as needed to support the larger effort
* focus on the best interest of the whole, at times at the expense of your own
* support team members, help them succeed and celebrate their success (be the "go-to" person)

It would help to clearly define the larger mission or the organization and your role in relation to it.

Soft skills cannot be spoon fed or forced upon someone. People must be made aware of them with a powerful message. People must be pushed to start to care. People must learn the basics, one at a time. If done right one can only estimate the incredible potential and added value of unlocking the full power of soft skills.
