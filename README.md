# Bridging the Soft Skills Gap

Certain people are acutely smart in their work (technical, easy to measure, *hard skills*). Others have an edge on the social side (non-technical, broad, *soft skills*). When employees have significant gaps in their soft skills there are significant negative consequences, e.g. customer service suffers, conflicts occur more frequently, unnecessary costs arise. Nine times out of ten an unsuccessful hire fails due to soft skills, not hard.

In order to engage and work together effectively with others it necessitates one skill set to blend in well with the other. You cannot have a functional workplace where everybody makes his or her own rules of conduct. Conforming to a set of basic practices is adequate and makes sense here. Thence, I have created a compendium of guidelines to follow to be able to communicate well and connect better.

The title of this post is eponymous to a great [book](https://www.amazon.com/Bridging-Soft-Skills-Gap-Missing/dp/1118725646/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IX0QI0ATUVKX&dchild=1&keywords=bridging+the+soft+skills+gap&qid=1593540443&s=books&sprefix=bridging+the+soft%2Caps%2C256&sr=1-1) by management coach Bruce Tulgan, on which much of this post is based. Further, ideas mentioned have been borrowed from the bestseller in Software Engineering [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=6GKZD0PUB6QK&dchild=1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer&qid=1593635880&s=books&sprefix=pragmatic%2Caps%2C252&sr=1-2) and split into 12 pivotal categories:


### 1. Self-Evaluation
### 2. Personal Responsibility
### 3. Attitude
### 4. Work Habits
### 5. People Skills
### 6. Proactive Learning
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 7. Problem-Solving
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 8. Decision-Making
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 9. Respect for Context
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world### 5. Citizenship
### 10. Citizenship
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 11. Service
* Vet information for legitimacy
### 12. Working in Teams
* Team lead should introduce you and help you in getting started (e.g. through a kick-off meeting)
* Read documentation or tutorial to understand the expectations (perhaps there is one for onboarding)
* Get a hang of the project vocabulary to have a starting point for conversation with teammates


Soft skills cannot be spoon fed or forced upon someone. People must be made aware of them with a powerful message. People must start to care. People must learn the basics, one at a time. If done right one can only estimate the incredible potential and added value of unlocking the full power of soft skills.
