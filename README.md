# Bridging the Soft Skills Gap

Certain people are acutely smart in their work (technical, easy to measure, *hard skills*). Others have an edge on the social side (non-technical, broad, *soft skills*). When employees have significant gaps in their soft skills there are significant negative consequences, e.g. good hires are overlooked, customer service suffers, conflicts occur more frequently, unnecessary costs arise. Nine times out of ten an unsuccessful hire fails due to soft skills, not hard.

You cannot have a functional workplace where everybody makes his or her own rules of conduct. Conforming to a set of basic practices is adequate and makes sense here. Thence, I have hunt down those guidelines and created a compendium out of them.

The title of this post is eponymous to a [great book](https://www.amazon.com/Bridging-Soft-Skills-Gap-Missing/dp/1118725646/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IX0QI0ATUVKX&dchild=1&keywords=bridging+the+soft+skills+gap&qid=1593540443&s=books&sprefix=bridging+the+soft%2Caps%2C256&sr=1-1) by management coach Bruce Tulgan on which much of this post is based.

### 1. Self-Evaluation
When it comes to continuous improvement of any kind self-evaluation is the beginning, middle and end. It refers to assessing one's own thoughts, words and actions against clear, meaningful standards; and one's own performance against specific goals, timelines, guidelines and parameters. Regular self-evaluation will build self-awareness and support your learning and growth going forward. Checklist includes 
* ability
* technical skills
* soft skills
* motivation
* productivity
* quality
* behavior
### 2. Personal Responsibility
The goal here is to take greater responsibility by learning to stay focused on what you can control directly and not defer the blame on external uncontrollable factors. At every step, ask yourself the following:
* What is within my control right now?
* Where will I focus my attention and energy? What are the options?
* What's the plan? What are my next steps?

Make a list of all the stones lying in the way and work out a response to remove them.
### 3. Attitude
According to studies good employeee attitude drive positive results. Bad employee attitude put a drag on results. Attitude is very, very important. It is changeable and definitely not a personal issue. Neither is it a vague term. A great attitude is defined by several traits (in the given order):
* expressions
* words
* tone
* gestures
* optimism
* generosity
* enthusiasm

Leverage good behavior and strengths. Identify bad attitude and take corrective action when it happens. Do not accept failure. If you learn to display a positive attitude regardless of how you feel inside, then you will have learned one of the most important broad transferable skills you could ever learn.
### 4. Work Habits
The company's business is directly impacted by work habits, e.g. coming late, not paying attention to detail and not taking initiative, all lead to missed opportunities. Good habits are:
* wellness (healthy body, mind, spirit)
* self-presentaion (grooming, attire, manners)
* timeliness (arriving early, staying late, taking short breajs, meeting schedules and deadlines)
* organization (taking notes, project plans, checklists, filing)
* productivity (pace of work)
* attention to details (following instructions, standards and specifications)
* follow-through (finishing commitments and started projects)
* initiative (no explicit direction, the extra mile)

Maintain a schedule to keep score and track progress. It takes weeks of practice to incorporate and form new habits. But the products of good habits are visible and so are the products of bad habits. It's your call.
### 5. People Skills
Attentive listening, observing and reading; perceiving and empathizing; effective use of words, tone, expressions, and gestures-verbal, written and otherwise-one-on-one and in groups; in person, and remotely.
### 6. Proactive Learning
Keeping an open mind, suspending judgment, questioning assumptions an seeking out information, technique, and perspective, and studying, practicing and contemplating in order to build one^s stored knowledge base, skill set and wisdom.
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 7. Problem-Solving
Mastering established best-practices-proven repeatable solutions for dealing with regular recurring decisions-so as to avoid reinventing the wheel. Using repeatable solutions to improvise when addressing decisions that are new but similar.
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 8. Decision-Making
Identifying and considering multiple options, assessing the pros and cons of each, and choosing the course of action closest to the desired outcome.
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 9. Respect for Context
Reading and adapting to the existing structure, rules, customs and leadership in an unfamiliar situation.
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world### 5. Citizenship
### 10. Citizenship
Accepting, embracing and observing, not just the rights and rewards, but the duties of membership/belonging/participation in a defined group with its own structure rules. customers, and leadership.
* Vet information for legitimacy, use value and broader implications in the real world
### 11. Service
Approaching relationships in terms of what you have to offer-respect, commitment, hard work, creativity, sacrifice-rather than what you need or want.
* Vet information for legitimacy
### 12. Working in Teams
Playing whatever role is needed to support the larger missions; coordinating, cooperating, and collaborating with others in pursuit of a shared goal; supporting and celebrating the success of others.
* Team lead should introduce you and help you in getting started (e.g. through a kick-off meeting)
* Read documentation or tutorial to understand the expectations (perhaps there is one for onboarding)
* Get a hang of the project vocabulary to have a starting point for conversation with teammates


Soft skills cannot be spoon fed or forced upon someone. People must be made aware of them with a powerful message. People must be pushed to start to care. People must learn the basics, one at a time. If done right one can only estimate the incredible potential and added value of unlocking the full power of soft skills.
