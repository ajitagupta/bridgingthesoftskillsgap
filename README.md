Title of this post is eponymous to the book by Bruce Tulgan.
Certain people are acutely smart in their work. Others have an edge on the social aspects of being a programmer. In order to be truly successful one must blend in one well with the other. I have created a compendium of guidelines to follow to be socially smart. This ranges from efficiently communicating with your boss to working together in teams.

1. Working in Teams
* Team lead should introduce you and help you in getting started
* Read documentation or tutorial to understand the expectations
* Get a hang of the project vocabulary to have a starting point for conversation with teammates


That said, you are never going to find the perfect work environment so invest your energy into the betterment of the current one.
